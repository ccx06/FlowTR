I was very surprised by the down home feel my wife and I received from the staff at the hotel from check-in to check-out. We were met by the doorman who graciously took care of our car and helped us check into our room. The young man at the desk did a great job of advising us on which tours to take and a great Italian restaurant in the West Loop neighborhood. Since we don't travel to large cities often we really appreciated the friendly atmosphere of the staff.........they always made us feel welcome and answered our questions easily and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant experience free from the hustle and bustle of big city life, well located and within walking distance of everything. Thanks to all for a wonderful weekend.................we plan on returning.","{'username': 'Tucker124', 'num_reviews': 1, 'id': '39AA7B174D045F1E2BAE8A398D00BBC2', 'location': 'Martin, Tennessee', 'num_helpful_votes': 2}",October 2010,111492,2,2010-10-25 00:00:00+00:00,84800976,False

The Camino Real chain bought the hotel from the Westin Chain and has let the hotel deteriorate over the past 10 years. It is unfortunate because the rooms are big but the Camino Real chain has spent zero money on upkeep. The furniture and rooms are very dated, the plumbing fixtures look old and our room heat did not work at all. When I checked in, other guests were complaining about service and problems. The Camino Real was once a great hotel chain, but the Mexican owners take zero pride in keeping things up. We stayed here only due to location but I doubt I will stay again.

The Bad~one of the queen beds was like sleeping on a roller coaster, apparently the frame was loose and every time you moved the whole bed did too. Carpet was stained. Bathtub drained very slow.

The whole room smelled like a funeral parlor.
The Ugly~I forgot my camera in the Tugs Resaurant at the table. I went back to look for it but it mysteriously disappeared. By the way there was only one other couple there, seated at the far end of the room and only one waitress. I called the next day and got the run around from everyone.

The Air-Con was hanging off the wall and made a banging sound 24/7 The furniture was from the 1970's the bed was as hard as nails, but overall the place was filthy, we changed rooms and the second one was just the same. we rung around other hotels but as it was 4th of July week everything was booked, so we were stuck!!
I always thought the Americans were picky, but they did not seem to mind the squalour of this place, although it is centrally located, close to all sightseeing and attractions I would not recommend it to anyone, I'm not posh by any means, but this place was squalid, you had to wear shoes in the rooms as the floors were sticky, don't even look under or behind the beds, you'd be sick, they smelt horrid damp and of urine, the bedlinnen had cigarette burns in it. 
Dont be fooled by the website pictures, the rooms are nothing like it shows, when we complaine dthey did not bat an eyelid and told us all the rooms were the same and if we wanted to check out we'd get a full refund off our holiday company, you could tell they dealt with these complaints all the time, I took 100's of photo's of New York but not one of the interior of this hotel as it was so disgusting and such a let down.

The place is well located on the Upper West Side, close to Central Park and the subway, so getting in and out of downtown is easy. The staff are very friendly and are happy to provide assistance or give advice if needed. The reservation was correct, which is even better.
The stairs are slow, but that's no problem because the stairs are available. The only other problem is that there is no to dry one's hands in the bathroom - you have to go back to your room or remember to take a towel with you - hand dryers would go a long way.

Room service was quick and good - I had a turkey club with fries and all was hot/cold where supposed to be; it came delivered on a rolling table instead of a tray, which I always think is a nice touch.
Everyone was extremely helpful - fast check-in, email my check-out folio, called a cab quickly, directed me on the walk to my business meeting, etc. Capitol Grille is right across the street for finer dining, and there seemed to be some places nearby for quicker and less expensive meals.

The hotel was first built around 1900, as an in-town spot for the wealthy to stay. It retains a lot of the features of that era, with mosaic tile floors and vintage woodwork. We felt it was extremely well-run and well-appointed. The bathrooms are small, as you would expect, but you have everything you need. A cold breakfast was served until 10:30, with hard-boiled eggs, cereals, lovely pastries, coffe, tea and juices. The staff, especially the General Manager, John, were very personable and helpful. The hotel is located at 12th and Spruce, a short walk to Market Street where you can pick up tour buses or the Pflash trolley that makes a continuous loop around the city. The historic district is about 6-7 blocks east. If you don't want to walk, taxis are plentiful and fairly cheap.

Very quiet at the weekend. Open top tour bus is the best way to travel because of value for money. City Sights NY was perfect. There is a bus stop a stone's throw from the hotel and the tube is one street up. 
The hotel breakfast didn't look great so we just ate out around. This wasn't a problem though as there are tons of yummy diners and cafes nearby. A&F is only down the road and tons of lovely restaurants too in a cobled street waterside area. Feels very european and classy (a nice contract from the brashness of time square).
The breakfast was the only disappointing thing about the hotel and we didn't eat it (may have been better than it looked). I would recommend going room only though. The prices are incredible, given the size of the room and quality of the hotel. Very stylish and boutique feel.
We were upgraded. It was my friends 30th. We stayed in room 805. Surely the best room in the hotel. As big as my sitting room and lounge put together!! I though NYC rooms were sposed to be small?!!!!?? Two massive double beds, a leather couch, a desk area. 
Bathroom didn't really match up with the 5 star standard of the room but it was pleasant and clean and well appointed.
Staff were friendly but left you to be independant. Perfect! Free internet and computer = a definate plus. 
We booked through Late rooms and paid 100-150 pounds a night. 50-70 each. What a bargain!!!

We were delighted to have the opportunity to return, now with our five children. Perhaps my sentimental expectations were too high, but we were profoundly disappointed. 
 We had a an executive suite connecting to a double/double ($700 plus per night pre-tax) PLUS another double/double for our nanny (ANOTHER $320ish per night pre-tax) The service was terrible, with one little thing snowballing into the next and here they are:
First, the hotel is on a busy downtown street with no pull-off area to unload a vehicle, I had to run inside to track down the valet during Seattle rush hour while my hubby and remaining family got honked at while idling in front of the hotel. Once in our rooms, the valet didn't bother to ask which bag went where -- just unloaded them all in the living room area. (i redirected). I asked abour our crib. He didn't know if there were cribs. He didn't know if the hotel had mini fridges available either . He said he would ask. He never did, so I tracked down the cribs. I was told by the front desk there were no mini fridges (i doubt this is true).
We had two bath towels in each bathroom for a family of 7. I did get more 45 minutes after my request.
The rooms have floor to ceiling windows. They are elegant and attractive. They are not practical. There is no closet or chest of drawers in the exec. suite bedroom (it's in the living area). The bed -- while comfortable -- takes up most of the room. There is only very limited counter space in the bathroom. It is an older tub shower.
The worst was our second floor location directly above busy First Street. The first night (a Sat.) was unbearable. We couldn't sleep but the front desk said it would be better the second night (a Sun) as there had been a parade and festival downtown on Sat. The front desk manager said she'd look around for other available rooms, but never bothered to call back. Despite mostly great reviews on TA, the most frequent negative was the noise which most reviewers assigned to passing garbage trucks. I was told via email in advance of our trip that our room requirements left the hotel with no choice but 2nd floor (lowest floor) rooms for us. But I was also told the garbage trucks had been rescheduled and this was no longer a hotel problem. Nonetheless, at 3 or 4 a.m. both nights we heard something that sounded like a garbage truck! I did not get out of bed to verify. On day 2, I asked for fans which helped drown out the noise on night two.
As we essentially had a 2-bedroom suite, there were three different TVs. All used different operating systems (lodgenet, etc.) so what was available on one was not necessarily available on the other. The maintenance man, originally summoned to fix the broken AC in one room, confirmed the other TVs weren't broken. He did not know why they were on different systems.
On Sunday morning at 8:30, I went to the lobby for some of the highly-touted iced coffee. It is promoted everywhere as being offered until 10 a.m. on the weekends, including on a sign on the table where the coffee is served. The pitcher was empty. I asked at the front desk and was told there wasn't any more. I said you can't run out of iced coffee unless you've run out of coffee, which is impossible in Seattle. She insisted they were, so I asked to see the manager on duty. After a punitive 10-minute wait, the m.o.d. came out and said it meant they would have to brew more then ice it down (yes! this is the complex recipe for iced coffee). She said it could take several minutes. I told her we'd be in the hotel restaurant. About 20 minutes later, she did bring it to me. We also had 4 $20 restaurant vouchers for b'fast as part of our package. I asked if we could use them for room service instead to spare the other guests the agony of dining next to our boisterous clan of 8. We were told no, which is how we ended up in the restaurant served by a cheerless waitress who brought GLASSES of ice water to everyone , including our one year old and two year olds in high chairs. When we asked her to take them away so the kids didn't knock them over, she knocked one over herself, getting the table and two people wet. No apology, but at least she gave herself an 18 percent tip for our ""convenience.""
The hotel's listed amenities include turndown service at night and a newspaper in the morning. We received neither. When I mentioned this at check out, the woman behind the desk said ""you have to request those."" How would one know to do this?
The only ""break"" i caught was when I ran out of milk for our baby after 6 p.m. which is when Seattle rolls up the carpet for the night. The Bookstore Bar bartender had mercy on me and filled up my 4oz sippy cup gratis. BTW, it is a beautiful, cozy, warm and charming bar. If I were traveling with my spouse only, we definitely would have had a drink or two there.
On the plus side, the hotel is convenient to Pike's Place. It does have a great bar. The beds are comfy. As I learned from other TA reviewers, you do get a $10 minibar credit and free wifi if you join kimpton in touch, which we did. You can check facebook for a password that will get you another perk. In July, it was ""flip flops"" which got us either two glasses of wine or a movie. No time for either but our tots enjoyed two half hour episodes of ""Dora the Explorer,"" which otherwise would have cost us $2.99 each (seriously).","{'username': 'euronovice', 'num_cities': 14, 'num_helpful_votes': 49, 'num_reviews': 25, 'num_type_reviews': 17, 'id': '10B3274A33B5895DC9833E2A88C01069', 'location': 'New Jersey'}",July 2011,112412,1,2011-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,116189947,False

The Suite was very spacious and had a great view of the garden from the terrace. The room was very clean and nicely laid out. The TV could definitely be bigger for such a large room, but not a big deal. The bathroom was also very clean and the shower/tub area was very spacious. We definitely loved the room.
You can tell by looking at the hotel and its finishings, that the hotel is old. It is nice and grand, but the age was showing. When we went to explore the pool area, the lady snapped at my wife asking for our room number. If she needs that information so we can just walk around the pool, she could have asked nicely. 
One big negative was parking - it costs $33 + tax to park here daily. We decided to go ahead and park here since our room was free of charge anyways. They told us to call down 5 minutes ahead of time when we needed our car. When we called down to get our car in the evening, there was no answer. We waited and called again 10 minutes later, no answer. We had to leave so we walked down and said we need our car immediately. Before I could even finish my sentence, the guy was telling me I should have called and I needed to wait. I didn't like his rude tone so I let him know it's his fault b/c no one was picking up the phone down there. The same thing happened AGAIN the next morning, and AGAIN he cut me off telling me I should have called ahead of time. He really pissed me off so I let him know he was being rude and didn't know what he was talking about.
Conclusion: Overall, this was a much better stay at an Omni for us. The hotel and room were very clean. But the interaction we had with the staff wasn't very good.","{'username': 'a300zx4pak', 'num_cities': 17, 'num_helpful_votes': 36, 'num_reviews': 61, 'num_type_reviews': 14, 'id': 'AFA5000392EA7EB871DBFA6ED9B291A2', 'location': 'Chicago'}",July 2011,84087,0,2011-09-12 00:00:00+00:00,118034566,False
"{'cleanliness': 5.0, 'value': 5.0, 'overall': 4.0, 'rooms': 5.0, 'service': 5.0}",“Loved the Hotel Commonwealth”,"Stayed at the Hotel Commonwealth for one night in April, 2004. Quite impressed. Room was large and beautiful with so many amenities. I had stayed at the Westin Copley Sq the evening before and even their ""heavenly"" beds did not compare to the comfort of the beds at the Hotel Commonwealth. The linens were first class and amazingly soft. The staff was gracious and helpful. The room was clean and new. While it is about a 20 minute walk to the ""rest"" of Boston, there is a subway stop right out front as well. Also, the 20 minute walk is down beautiful Commonwealth avenue, so it is not a hardship in the least. Prices were reasonable for the Boston area, with parking included in my package. Note that traffic gets heavy around the hotel when there are games at Fenway and you may have to work around that in your departure times. All in all, a small hotel to rival the large chains...a ""secret"" that eventually won't be so secret.","{'username': 'mreav', 'num_cities': 7, 'num_helpful_votes': 70, 'num_reviews': 7, 'num_type_reviews': 7, 'id': 'BC88E08EBF49D9D6BB6C89CA4168E15B', 'location': ''}",January 2005,258705,5,2004-04-23 00:00:00+00:00,1833647,False

{'overall': 2.0},“Wish I could have rated it higher...”,"Stayed here for business. When we first arrived...lots of construction going on outside the property. Check in was speedy & the front desk clerk was pleasant. Lobby was nice. I was put in an accessible room on the 2nd floor. So I had lots of space. Property is very clearly aged. Basic amenities in room. Shower was awesome...hot & great water pressure. It would have been nice to have lotion in the bathroom. Bed was ok. I liked that they had a microwave & fridge in the room. Flat screen TV with lots of channels. Nice selections for breakfast. Downfalls...older property, basic in room amenities, Internet moves at a snail's pace (that sucks when you're staying here for business), walls are thin (you can hear folks in adjoining rooms & all way). I love Marriotts...wish I could have rated this property higher.","{'username': 'busyvatraveler', 'num_cities': 8, 'num_helpful_votes': 5, 'num_reviews': 14, 'num_type_reviews': 5, 'id': '3610AD3F5D0CEDEBD64785494FE839EE', 'location': 'Richmond, VA'}",September 2012,223829,0,2012-09-13 00:00:00+00:00,140201487,False
