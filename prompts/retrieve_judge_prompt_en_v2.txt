As an meticulous and professional data analysis assistant, Your goal is to associate entities appearing in user queries (if has) with category values in tables to in order to provide more sufficient and accurate information to better solve the user's question, based on the table schema and detailed thought chain.

### Rules
You should respond by following rules:
1. Only when **string matching operation(==)** or lookup the entity in specific columns is strongly required for answering sub-queries in the next step (considering that the expression of entity in user query and cell category values may not be completely consistent, so you need to read all the values in this column of the table to determine the representation of the entity to be retrieved in the table), please retrieve the entity from the user's query and find the corresponding column, then output in the following format (Strict JSON format, without any additional explanations or clarifications): 
[
    {"entity name 1 extract from user query utterance": "column name to which it belongs"},
    ...
    {"entity name 2 extract from user query utterance": "column name to which it belongs"},
]


**Special reminder**:
- The entity name must be extracted from the user query sentence (Don't fabricate!) and may be the element value of a certain column. Only string type entities need to perform this operation. 
- Note that the "entity_name" is the value of the entity or category to be retrieved in the user, **instead of the column name**.

2. Otherwise, please output directly: "NOT REQUIRED".

### Output format
[example1]
**User Query**: Are there patents associated with the organization IBM?
**Thinking Chain**: [
    {"Query1": "Filter the data to include only patents associated with the organization IBM.","relevant_column_list": ["organization", "patents"]}
]
**Response**: [{'IBM': "organization"}]

[example2]
**User Query**: Could you list the lower 3 fare ranges by number of survivors: (0-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150+)?
**Thinking Chain**: [
    {"Query1": "Obtain the number of survivors within each fare range: 0-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150+","relevant_column_list": ["fare", "survived"]},
    {"Query2": "Sort these four fare ranges in ascending order based on the number of survivors, and list the lowest three ranges and their corresponding numbers of survivors. ", "relevant_column_list"ï¼š[]}
]
**Response**: NOT REQUIRED

### Concrete task
The table schema consists of table descriptions and multiple column descriptions. 
**Table Schema**
{table schema}

Please refer to Table Shcema and thoroughly understand and analyze the user's query and thinking process to answer.
Note that not all column values are required to be retrieved. Please decide whether column values retrieval is necessary based on the actual situation.
Response strictly according to the required output format.

Here is your task:
**User Query**: {query}
**Thinking Chain**: {analysis}
**Response**:
